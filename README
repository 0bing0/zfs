============================ ZFS KERNEL BUILD ============================

1) Build the SPL (Solaris Porting Layer) module which is designed to
   provide many Solaris APIs in the Linux kernel which are needed
   by ZFS.  To build the SPL:

        tar -xzf spl-x.y.z.tgz
        cd spl-x.y.z
        ./configure --with-linux=<kernel src>
        make
        make check <as root>

2) Build ZFS, this port is based on build specified by the ZFS.RELEASE
   file.  You will need to have both the kernel and SPL source available.
   To build ZFS for use as a Linux kernel module.

        tar -xzf zfs-x.y.z.tgz
        cd zfs-x.y.z
        ./configure --with-linux=<kernel src> \
                    --with-spl=<spl src>
        make
        make check <as root>

============================ ZPIOS TEST SUITE ============================

3) Provided is an in-kernel test application called zpios which can be
   used to simulate a parallel IO load.  It may be used as a stress 
   or performance test for your configuration.  To simplify testing
   scripts provided in the scripts/ directory which provide a few
   pre-built zpool configurations and zpios test cases.  By default
   'make check' as root will run a simple test against several small
   loopback devices created in /tmp/.

       cd scripts
       ./zfs.sh					# Load the ZFS/SPL modules
       ./zpios.sh -c lo-raid0.sh -t tiny -v 	# Tiny zpios loopback test
       ./zfs.sh -u				# Unload the ZFS/SPL modules
