============================ ZFS KERNEL BUILD ============================

1) Build the SPL (Solaris Porting Layer) module which is designed to
   provide many Solaris APIs in the Linux kernel which are needed
   by ZFS.  To build the SPL:

        tar -xzf spl-x.y.z.tgz
        cd spl-x.y.z
        ./configure --with-linux=<kernel src>
        make
        make check <as root>

2) Build ZFS, this port is based on build 89 of ZFS from OpenSolaris.
   You will need to have both the kernel and SPL source available.
   To build ZFS for use as a Linux kernel module (default):

        tar -xzf zfs-x.y.z.tgz
        cd zfs-x.y.z
        ./configure --with-linux=<kernel src> \
                    --with-spl=<spl src>
        make
        make check <as root>

========================= ZFS USER LIBRARY BUILD =========================

1) Build ZFS, this port is based on build 89 of ZFS from OpenSolaris.
   To build ZFS as a userspace library:

        tar -xzf zfs-x.y.z.tgz
        cd zfs-x.y.z
        ./configure --zfsconfig=user
        make
        make check <as root>

============================ ZPIOS TEST SUITE ============================

3) Provided is an in-kernel test application called zpios which can be
   used to simulate a parallel IO load.  It may be used as a stress test
   or as a performance to measure your configuration.  To simplify testing
   there are scripts provided in the scripts/ directory.  A single test
   can be run as follows:

        WARNING: You MUST update DEVICES in the create-zpool.sh script
                 to reference the devices you wish to use.

       cd scripts
       ./load-zfs.sh		# Load the ZFS/SPL module stack
       ./create-zpool.sh	# Modify DEVICES to list your zpool devices
       ./zpios.sh		# Modify for your particular zpios test
       ./unload-zfs.sh		# Unload the ZFS/SPL module stack
