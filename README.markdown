Native ZFS for Linux! ZFS is an advanced file system and volume manager
which was originally developed for Solaris. It has been successfully 
ported to FreeBSD and now there is a functional Linux ZFS kernel port
too. The port currently includes a fully functional and stable SPA, DMU,
and ZVOL with a ZFS Posix Layer (ZPL) on the way!

Documentation for building, configuring, and using ZFS can be found at:
