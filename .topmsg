Subject: [PATCH] linux have sysevent

Use sysevent if HAVE_SYSEVENT defined

We don't have FMA in Linux, so disable spa_event_notify() to allow
compilation.  It would be a good idea to code at least some kind of
ad-hoc notification for such events, e.g., make it output some syslog
messages when a disk faults/fails.

Also, I think it's FMA in Solaris that is responsible for triggering the
hot spares when a disk starts failing, so we should also think about
doing this in Linux.
