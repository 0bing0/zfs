Subject: [PATCH] zfs branch

Merged result of all changes which are relevant to both Solaris
and Linux builds of the ZFS code.  These are changes where there
is a reasonable chance they will be accepted upstream.

Additionally, since this is effectively the root of the linux
ZFS tree the core linux build system is added here.  This
includes autogen.sh, configure.ac, m4 macros, some scripts/*,
and makefiles for all the core ZFS components.  Linux-only
features which require tweaks to the build system should appear
on the relevant topic branches.  All autotools products which
result from autogen.sh are commited to the linux-configure-branch.

This branch also contains the META, ChangeLog, AUTHORS,
README, and GIT files.
