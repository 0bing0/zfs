Subject: [PATCH] linux-sha2

The upstream ZFS code has correctly moved to a faster native sha2
implementation.  Unfortunately, under Linux that's going to be a little
problematic so we revert the code to the more portable version contained
in earlier ZFS releases.  Using the native sha2 implementation in Linux
is possible but the API is slightly different in kernel version user
space depending on which libraries are used.  Ideally, we need a fast
implementation of SHA256 which builds as part of ZFS this shouldn't be
that hard to do but it will take some effort.
