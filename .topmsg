Subject: [PATCH] fix no debug userspace

Disable debug code on userspace

This one has been filed with the ZFS team and they haven't presented
any objections so far. Basically, in some places the ZFS code was
assuming that !_KERNEL == debug mode, which isn't always true.

There's also a symbol collision fix in the debug code (verify).
