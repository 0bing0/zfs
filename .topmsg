Subject: [PATCH] fix metaslab

If your only going to allow one allocator to be used and it is defined
at compile time there is no point including the others in the build.
This patch could/should be refined for Linux to make the metaslab
configurable at run time.  That might be a bit tricky however since
you would need to quiese all IO.  Short of that making it configurable
as a module load option would be a reasonable compromise.
