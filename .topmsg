Subject: [PATCH] gcc fortify source

Resolve issues uncovered by -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2, the default redhat
macro's file adds this option to the cflags.  This causes warnings
of the following type designed to keep the developer honest:

        warning: ignoring return value of 'foo', declared
                 with attribute warn_unused_result

The short term fix is to wrap these calls in VERIFY() to check the
return code.  The code was already assusing these would never fail.
