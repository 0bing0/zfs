Subject: [PATCH] fix stack lzjb

Reduce kernel stack usage by lzjb_compress() by moving uint16 array
off the stack and on to the heap.  The exact performance implications
of this I have not measured but we absolutely need to keep stack
usage to a minimum.  If/when this becomes and issue we optimize.
