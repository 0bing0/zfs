SUMMARY OF MAJOR KNOWN PROBLEMS IN v0.4.1 (Development Release)

- 2009-01-26 16:23:00 SPLError: 7884:1360:(dnode.c:146:dnode_verify())
  VERIFY3(dn->dn_nblkptr >= 1) failed (0 >= 1)

  When enabling debugging in ZFS with the --enable-debug configure option
  we always trip the following VERIFY.  This issue was present in the
  previous 0.3.3 release and was avoided simply by leaving debugging
  disabled until it could be explained.  Well it has not just gone
  always with the update to b105 so we need to run it to ground and 
  explain what is going on.

- Implement FLUSH support probably in terms of a barrier as part of
  the vdev_disk.c interface.  Required for correctness.

- Implement something similar to the Solaris devid support to ensure
  ZFS properly locates your disks even when moved.  The current port
  is dependant on using something like udev to ensure this can never
  happen but this is not a viable long term solution.

- Implement something like Solaris's sysevent support to detect when
  drives appear or are removed.  There is no easy analog to my knowledge
  for linux and we will need to come up with something.

- Integrate Ricardo XDR support for on disk encoding.  This mainly
  just needs a good review and to be updated against this code tree.

- Ztest failures have been observed after 8+ hours of runtime.  This
  needs to be investigated and resolved.

- Get the ZVOL working as a vehicle for further stress testing under
  Linux, and to provide one useful user space interface for access to
  the DMU.

- Get the ZPL working minimal support will be needed for lustre.

- If Richardo is willing integrate his FUSE port in to this code base.
