SUMMARY OF MAJOR KNOWN PROBLEMS IN v0.4.5 (Development Release)

- Implement something similar to the Solaris devid support to ensure
  ZFS properly locates your disks even when moved.  The current port
  is dependent on using something like udev to ensure this can never
  happen but this is not a viable long term solution.

- Implement something like Solaris's sysevent support to detect when
  drives appear or are removed.  There is no easy analog to my knowledge
  for linux and we will need to come up with something.

- Get the ZVOL working as a vehicle for further stress testing under
  Linux, and to provide one useful user space interface for access to
  the DMU.

- Get the ZPL working minimal support will be needed for lustre.

- Integrate the FUSE port in to this code base, or rebase it as its
  own zfs-fuse package which is built against the zfs-devel package.
