	* : Tag zfs-0.4.3 - Use 'git log --no-merges' for full change log.

	* : Rebased to ZFS b108 from OpenSolaris

	* configure.ac, *Makefile.am: Build system update.  This includes
	resolving various build issues and adding support for the remaining
	common build targets.  Available targets now include:

	- make all        # Build everything
	- make install    # Install everything
	- make clean      # Clean up build products
	- make distclean  # Clean up everything
	- make dist       # Create package tarball
	- make srpm       # Create package source RPM
	- make rpm        # Create package binary RPMs
	- make tags       # Create ctags and etags for everything

	Extra care was taken to ensure that the source RPMs are fully
	rebuildable against Fedora/RHEL/Chaos kernels.  To build binary
	RPMs from the source RPM for your system simply run:

	rpmbuild --rebuild zfs-x.y.z-1.src.rpm

	This will produce two binary RPMs with correct 'requires'
	dependencies for your kernel.  One will contain all zfs modules
	and support utilities, the other is a devel package for compiling
	additional kernel modules which are dependent on the zfs.

	zfs-x.y.z-1_<kernel version>.x86_64.rpm
	zfs-devel-x.y.2-1_<kernel version>.x86_64.rpm

	* config/kernel.m4, config/Rules.am: Removed the build options
	-Wno-unused -Wno-missing -Wno-unused -Wno-parentheses and
	-Wno-unknown-pragmas.  All upstream warnings which were being
	suppressed by these options are now handled in the matching
	gcc-* topic branch.

	* zpios: Various zpios and test infrastructure improvements.

	* feature-commit-cb: New feature commit callbacks.

	* : Various bug fixes which are more clearly detailed in the
	git commit logs.  For a detailed summary of changes post version
	0.4.2, check out the 'top' topic branch and view the commit logs.

	git checkout top
	git log --no-merges -53

2009-02-05 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag zfs-0.4.2

	* lib/libzfs/libzfs_util.c: Remove mknod() this is now handled by
	by the SPL with an upcall even without GPL-only symbols.

	* module/zfs/vdev_diskc: Updated linux vdev_disk interfaces to issue
	multiple bios if needed due to the maximum request size being smaller
	than the request size passed down from the spa.

	* scripts/zpool-config/lo-*: Add loopback based test configs.

2009-01-21 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag zfs-0.4.1

	* : Rebased to ZFS b105 from OpenSolaris

	* : Restructured project and build system to more closely
	mirror the code organization used in OpenSolaris.  This
	allows us minimize the changes to upstream source needed,
	and allows concurrent user+kernel space builds of all components.

2008-11-19 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag zfs-0.4.0

	* : ZFS project migrated from Subversion which leveraged a 
	quilt based patch stack to Git and a TopGit managed patch
	stack.  The new method treats all patches as Git branches
	which can be more easily shared for distributed development.
	Consult the top level GIT file for detailed information on
	how to properly develop for this package using Git+TopGit.

2008-11-12 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag zfs-0.3.4

	* zfs-07-create-dev-zfs.patch:
	Ricardo M. Correia <Ricardo.M.Correia@sun.com>
	- Make libzfs create /dev/zfs if it doesn't exist.

	* zfs-05-check-zvol-size.patch:
	Ricardo M. Correia <Ricardo.M.Correia@sun.com>
	- Properly check zvol size under Linux.

	* zfs-04-no-openat-fdopendir.patch:
	Ricardo M. Correia <Ricardo.M.Correia@sun.com>
	- Do not use openat() and fdopendir() since they are not available
	  on older systems.

	* zfs-03-fix-bio-sync.patch:
	Ricardo M. Correia <Ricardo.M.Correia@sun.com>
	- Fix memory corruption in RHEL4 due to synchronous IO becoming
	  asynchronous.

2008-11-06 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* zfs-02-zpios-fix-stuck-thread-memleak.patch:
	Ricardo M. Correia <Ricardo.M.Correia@sun.com>
	- Fix stuck threads and memory leaks when errors occur while writing.

	* zfs-01-zpios-arg-corruption.patch:
	Ricardo M. Correia <Ricardo.M.Correia@sun.com>
	- Fix zpios cmd line argument corruption problem.

	* zfs-00-minor-fixes.patch: 
	Ricardo M. Correia <Ricardo.M.Correia@sun.com>
	- Minor build system improvements
	- Minor script improvements
	- Create a full copy and not a link tree with quilt
	- ZPIOS_MAJOR changed from 231 to 232
	- BIO_RW_BARRIER flag removed from IO request

2008-06-30 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag zfs-0.3.3

	* : Minor script updates and tweaks to be compatible with
	the latest version of the SPL.

2008-06-13 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* vdev_disk.diff: Replace vdev_disk implementation which was
	based on the kmalloc'ed logical address space with a version
	which works with vmalloc'ed memory in the virtual address space.
	This was done to support the new SPL slab implementation which
	is based on virtual addresses to avoid the need for contigeously
	allocated memory.

2008-06-05 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* arc-vm-integration.diff: Reduce maximum default arc memory 
	usage to 1/4 of total system memory.  Because all the bulk data
	is still allocated on the slab memory fragmentation is a serious
	concern.  To address this in the short term we simply need to
	leave lots of free memory.

	* fix-stack.diff: First step towards reducing stack usage so
	we can run the full ZFS stack using a stock kernel.

2008-06-04 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag zfs-0.3.2

	* : Extensive improvements to the build system to detect kernel
	API changes so we can flexibly build with a wider range of kernel
	versions.  The code has now been testing with the 2.6.18-32chaos
	and 2.6.25.3-18.fc9 kernels, however we should also be compatible
	with other kernels in the range of 2.6.18-2.6.25.  The only
	remaining issue preventing us from running with a stock 
	kernel is ZFS stack usage.

2008-05-21 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag zfs-0.3.1

	* : License headers including URCL added for release.

2008-05-21 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag zfs-0.3.0

	* configure.ac: Improved autotools support and configurable debug.

2008-05-15 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* : Updating original ZFS sources to build 89 which
	includes the new write throttling changes plus support
	for using ZFS as your root device.  Neither of which
	will work exactly right without some more work but this
	gets us much closers to the latest source.
	

2008-02-28 Brian Behlendorf <behlendorf1@llnl.gov>

	* : First attempt based on SPL module and zfs-lustre sources
